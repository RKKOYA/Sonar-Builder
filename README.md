# Sonar Builder

## Project Description
The Sonar Builder project aims to create a 3D map based on sonar logs recorded from Lowrance fish sonar product specifically for the HDS Live 9, though this software may work for sonar logs produced from different Lowrance hardware. The project allows users to visualize and better understand their fishing environment.
